### Plex Setup
1. Get your server URL (e.g., `https://iloveplex.com`)
2. Find your X-Plex-Token:

   Open your browser's developer console (`F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd + Option + I` on Mac), go to the **Console** tab, and run:

   ```javascript
   console.log("X-Plex-Token:", localStorage.getItem("myPlexAccessToken") || "Not found");
   ```

   This will print your Plex token if it's stored in `localStorage`.
